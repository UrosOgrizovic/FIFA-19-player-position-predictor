# Overview

The goal is to predict the position of a player in the video game FIFA 19 based on the player's attributes. As the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) is unbalanced, predicting a player's position with high accuracy was more difficult than expected. Hence, positions were grouped into sections, which made the dataset more balanced, and the predictions more accurate.

# Data

Total number of players: 14517.
